## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To utilize this library, you need to have [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed on your system.

Next, include the library in your project:

```js

const data = {
    labels: ["12am-3am", "3am-6pm", "6am-9am", "9am-12am",
        "12pm-3pm", "3pm-6pm", "6pm-9pm", "9am-12am"
    ],
    datasets: [
        {
